# Internship-task-3
# House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project predicts house prices using a Linear Regression model. I used the `Housing.csv` dataset, which includes features like area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and other property details.

###  What I Did:
- Imported and cleaned the dataset
- Encoded categorical columns
- Split data into training and testing sets
- Trained a Linear Regression model
- Evaluated the model using MAE, MSE, and RÂ² Score
- Visualized the results using a scatter plot
- Interpreted model coefficients to understand feature impact

###  Technologies Used:
- Python 
- pandas 
- numpy 
- scikit-learn 
- matplotlib & seaborn 

This is a simple and effective regression project to understand how machine learning can be used to predict continuous values like house prices.
